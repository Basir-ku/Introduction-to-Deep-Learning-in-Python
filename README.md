# Introduction-to-Deep-Learning-in-Python
Deep learning with Keras 2.0, the latest version of a cutting-edge library for deep learning in Python.

Deep learning is the machine learning technique behind the most exciting capabilities in diverse areas like robotics, natural language processing, image recognition, and artificial intelligence, including the famous AlphaGo. In this course, you'll gain hands-on, practical knowledge of how to use deep learning with Keras 2.0, the latest version of a cutting-edge library for deep learning in Python.

1. Basics of deep learning and neural networks: In first notebook, you'll become familiar with the fundamental concepts and terminology used in deep learning, and understand why deep learning techniques are so powerful today. You'll build simple neural networks and generate predictions with them.

2. Optimizing a neural network with backward propagation: Learn how to optimize the predictions generated by your neural networks. You'll use a method called backward propagation, which is one of the most important techniques in deep learning.
